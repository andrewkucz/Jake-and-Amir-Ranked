## Jake & Amir Ranked

### By Andrew Kuczynski

#### What/Why
Jake & Amir Ranked is a simple web application with the goal of using the wisdom of the crowds to determine the indisputable best Jake and Amir episode. (Jake and Amir is a discontinued, popular, CollegeHumor web series with over 600 episodes) 

Based on the [ELO Rating System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) this app works by pitting 2 random episodes in a head to head vote and adjusting their ratings based on the outcome, according to a specific formula. Over time and with a LOT of user votes, an epsiodes ELO rating will be a great indicator of it's ranking in the population of videos. The more votes, the more accurate the Leaderboard, so get voting!

This project was my first personal React project and was meant to be a fun learning experience more than anything.

#### How to play
Vote for which video you think is better using the buttons below them. You can watch the videos if you want a refresher or just speed vote to improve the accuracy of the leaderboard.
NOTE: Every vote impacts both video's ELO rating, even if it doesn't look like the leaderboards are affected
